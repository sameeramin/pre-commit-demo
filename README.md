# pre-commit-demo
This is a demo repository that demonstrates how to integrate pre-commit in a project consisting of various files including text, yaml, python, javascript, css, and html.

## Prerequisites
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/sameeramin/pre-commit-demo.git
```
2. Install pre-commit: 
```
brew install pre-commit
```
Or
```
pip install pre-commit
```
Or if you're using `anaconda` or `miniconda`
```
conda install pre-commit
```
3. Run `pre-commit install` to install the git hook

4. Make your changes and commit. You will see pre-commit running the hooks automatically. If you want to run it on existing files run 
```
pre-commit run --all-files  
```

## Available Hooks
- `check-yaml`: checks yaml file for proper formatting
- `end-of-file-fixer`: checks for newline at end of files
- `trailing-whitespace`: checks for whitespaces at the end of lines
- `black`: auto-formats python code to conform to PEP8 style
- `flake8`: checks for code style and errors

You can add more hooks as per your project requirements. Here's the [list](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html) of all supported hooks and you can also create your own hooks as well!

## Note
Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed before running the pre-commit hooks

You can add or remove hooks in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file
